# 🎨 Art Attack – Just Me Messing Around With HTML & CSS

Welcome to Art Attack, a tiny corner of the internet where I mess around with HTML and CSS just for fun.
No serious purpose. No rules. No deadlines.
Just vibes. ✨

I’m basically recreating random objects, animals, and whatever pops into my head using only HTML + CSS.
Think of it as digital doodling. 🎨💻

<br />

## 🐣 Status

Right now:
I’ve set up the basics… and that’s it. 😄
The actual designs are coming soon-ish. Or whenever I feel inspired.

<br />

## 💡 Things I might make next

- 🐼 Panda
- 🎉 Probably some other weird or cute things

<br />

## 🛠 Tools I'm Using

HTML, CSS, Imagination, Time where I could be productive (optional but recommended)

<br />

## 🧩 Why?

Because it’s fun.
Because CSS can do some wild things.
And because making a panda out of divs sounds hilarious.

<br />

## ✨ Stay Tuned

More silly, fun, CSS-made “art” will show up here soon!
